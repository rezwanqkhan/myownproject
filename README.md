# Personal Blog Web

This is a personal blog web page developed using the Laravel framework with MVC architecture. It served as my first internet project. The platform enables the owner, who is the sole user, to control the site from the admin panel.

The owner can update their profile details, add new posts, edit existing posts, and delete them. New posts can be published through the admin panel or backend, with changes reflected on the frontend.


For the frontend design, I utilized HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and Bootstrap Starter, customizing them to suit the project's needs. In terms of the admin panel, I integrated JavaScript and PHP. The admin panel view was implemented from an online resource, then customized to align with the project's requirements.

For data management, PHPMyAdmin was used to handle the database. The following screenshots were taken from a localhost environment during development.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
